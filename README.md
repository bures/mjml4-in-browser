# MJML 4 in browser (ES5)

This module packages MJML 4 (https://github.com/mjmlio/mjml) to run in browser. 

It works by mocking some nodejs modules that are not available in a browser. This means several limitations, such as:

- mj-include is not supported
- and possibly many more

Nevertheless for the simple use in a webbrowser this works fine.
